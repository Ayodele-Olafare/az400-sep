monolithic setup:
--------------------
disadvantage:
1. Dependent applications.
2. dont have any automation
3. No scale-in and scale-out capbility.


virtual machines:
------------------
4 virtual machines has been created.but only 1 in use.
boot period for  vm is ~ 1 to 2 mins.

containerization:
------------------
dockerhub
docker host : machine where containerization(docker) software is present.
images
containers
dockerfile  : text file which contains application code along with dependencies information
1. will always have a name as dockerfile.
2. you build a dockerfile to create image.



How to write a dockerfile:
FROM : what will be the base image of your container.
RUN: It is used to execute a command , install a package, uninstanll a package.
ENV: define a variable and its value which can be used in docerfile.
WORKDIR: used to specify directory where commands can be executed.
COPY: copy a file from dockerhost to container.
ADD: copy files from dockerhost and unzips it in container directory.
CMD: Run a commnd at the time of container launc, can be overwritten.
ENTRYPOINT: Run a commnd at the time of container launch can not be overwritten.

usecase: developer has written one index.html file which needs nginx software to host which is using ubuntu os, 
exposing one networking port as 80 for application to work.

code: index.html
req:
	1. ubuntu os
	2. nginx webserver
	3. network port 80


FROM ubuntu:5.1
RUN apt-get update
RUN apt-get install nginx -y
COPY index.html /var/www/html
EXPOSE 80
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]


Usecase: deploy one asp.net application which is used to create a static website by using container . 
This container image must be present in a private repository hosted on azure.

dependencies:
-------------
dockerfile
development files 
source code

Requirements:
-------------
azure infrstructure must be present
resource group
acr : private imange/container registry hosted on azure cloud. azure container repository
web applications



Azure resources:
------------------
1. subscription: It ised to group together all resources for one environment.
2. Resource group" It is used to group resources based on its utility in one subscription.
